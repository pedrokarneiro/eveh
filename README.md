The idea is to make working with the Virtual Environment easier, which didn't seem very straightforward to manage. I hope the idea evolves and can contemplate other command line operations for those who work with Python, aiming at a more structured and standardized environment.

At first, the idea was implemented for Python developers who work primarily in a Windows environment. For this reason, both the creation script and the created scripts were elaborated in Batch file script, considering MS VSCode as editor / IDE.

Any help, change, evolution, suggestion will be welcome.
